## Data Analysis Portfolio

### About Me
Hello! I am a secondary math teacher who is excited about transitioning into data analysis. Throughout my teaching career I have worked in a variety of team settings, analyzed data to make informed decisions, and created engaging presentations. I am organized, detail-oriented and adaptable. 

I hold a Bachelor of Science  in Mathematics from Central Connecticut State University graduating Magna Cum Laude and achieving the ETS Recognition of Excellence in Mathematics. I first became interested in data analysis when I saw the impact on teaching and learning in the classroom. Upon deciding to transition to data analysis, I completed the Google Data Analytics certificate. I now continue to learn and refine my skills in Tableau, SQL, R and Excel. I believe in being a reflective life-long learner and enjoy seeking out new challenges.
